    "text": "Recommendations\nThe two biggest problems with climate change in these parks appear to be the temperature increase and decrease in the amount of water in the environment. It is difficult to conclude if whether one is causing the other as both have negative impacts on the vegetation. My recommendation would be to combat the reduction of water in the environment as the increase in temperature is likely causing the reduction of water and reducing the temperature in the national parks does not seem feasible.\nIn order to counteract the reduction of water, park rangers could focus on watering the soil of these regions, specifically during the spring. Watering in the spring is most important as that is when it is decreasing most rapidly. Even though there is an increase in tree canopy overall over time, in the most recent years there has been a decrease in tree canopy so planting trees could be helpful to combat this."

    "section": "Insights and Trends",
    "text": "Insights and Trends\nWe will first look at the changes in the climate followed by the changes in the vegetation types and the relationships between the climate changes and vegetation changes.\n\nThe Rise in Temperature\nThe average temperature has risen over time in the Four Corners region. By taking the average annual temperature across all sample locations, we can see the upward trend in the line plot below. The peak average annual temperature occurs in 2018 with 12.9 degrees celsius. In 1980, the annual average temperature was 10.8 degrees celsius. From 1980-2017, we can see flucuations in the annual average temperature. Following 2018, the temperature in 2021-2024 does not flucuate below 11.7 degrees celsius. This indicates an alarming rise in the climate temperature.\n\n\nTemperature Across Seasons\nIn addition to looking at the average temperature across the entire year, we can compare the winter and summer temperature data. In the visualization below, we can observe the similar fluxations in the winter and summer temperatures from 1980-2017 as in the annual temperature. From 2017-2024, we see a steady increase in temperature indicating a more permanent rising temperature in the winter, summer, and average annual temperatures.\n\n\n\nSummer Temperature\nCompared to the winter and annual temperatures, the summer average temperature has risen the most rapidly. By computing a correlation matrix, summer temperature had a 0.474 correlation with the year, followed by annual temperature with a 0.473 correlation and winter temperature with a 0.124 correlation. These statistics show that the summer temperature has risen the most over time compared to the winter and annual temperatures. Looking at the summer average annual temperature on its own, we can see rising temperature fluxations from 1980-2017 and a drastic incline from 2018-2024.\n\n\n\nTemperature Across Locations\nWe can further see the rise in temperature by looking at the temperature by sample location. The heatmaps show the locations where the temperature is the highest, indicated by red colors, and show lower temperature with blue colors. We will compare three different time periods to show the rise and expansion of temperature over time.\n\n\n1980\nIn 1980, we see that the hot spots follow the White Canyon River. There are also hot spots in the southeastern region of the area.\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\n\n\n2018\nIn 2018, the patterns are very similar to 1980. The hot spots follow the river and some spots in the southeastern region.\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\n\n\n2023\nIn 2023, we see larger hot spots among the White Canyon River appear larger and darker, suggesting a temperature increase in this region.\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\n\n\nTemperature Over Time by Sample Location\nWe can use this interactive visualization to look at the annual temperature samples across the time period and for specific years. We see the increase of red dots over time, suggesting an increase in temperature. There is also an increase of samples in the near-term data from 2021-2024.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nDecrease in Frost Days\nSimilar to an increase in temperature, there has been a decrease in the number of frost days over time as shown in the line plot below. Similar to temperature, we can see flucuations in high frost years and low frost years until a sharp decrease in recent years.\n\n\n\nDecrease in Summmer Evaporation\nThe decrease in summer evaporation is shown below through the trend line in the scatter plot. We can also see the cluster of near-term data together, 2021-2024, which contrasts the flucuations of previous years.\n\n\n\nDecrease in the Water Soil Content in Fall, Winter, and Spring Over Time\nWhen comparing the water soil content by season over the time period, we see the biggest decrease in the Spring, followed by the fall and winter. There is a very slight increase of water soil content in the summer over time.\n\n\n\nDecrease in Shrubs, Plant Litter, and Herbs\nThe change in vegetation across seasons can be seen with the following visualizations. There has been a decrease in the amount of shrubs, plant litter, and herbs as shown in the decrease of percentage of these vegetation types across sample locations. The amount of shrubs has decreased the most followed by herbs and plant litter. These changes over time show the impact of climate change on vegetation in the Four Corners region.\n\n\nShrubs Over Time\nAs Shrubs had the largest change over time, we will look at shrub percentages by location over time. Even though there are a few locations that show change, there are many locations that remain unchanged. This shows the vegetation resilience of shrubs despite changes in the climate.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nRelationship Between Spring Soil Water and Plant Litter\nWe can see that there is a positive relationship between spring soil water and plant litter across locations by year. Meaning that the more water in the soil there is in the spring, the more plant litter. The less soil water, then there will be less plant litter. As the spring soil water is decreasing over time, this could explain the reduction in plant litter over time. We will only look at individual years to exclude the time variable as we know that plant litter decreases overtime as shown in the plots above.\n\n\n\nRelationship Between Spring Soil Water and Shrubs\nThere is also a positive relationship between the amount of water in the spring soil and shrubs. Similar to plant litter, more water is associated with more shrubs. As spring soil water has decreased over time, we can hypothesize that the decrease in water has decreased the amount of shrubs in the Four Corners region.\n\n\n\n\nIncrease in Bare Land\nIn addition to the decrease in vegetation, there has been an increase in bare land shown through average bare land percentage. Interestingly, there seems to be a steady flucuating increase of bare land from 1980-early 2000s followed by more steady flucuations.\n\n\nBare Land Over Time\nWe can see the large amount of bare land over time. Similar to shrub counts, only a few locations have changes in their amounts of bare land.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nRelationship Between Bare Land and Summer Temperature\nUsing one year, 1980, to keep the time variable constant, we see that bare land and temperature are positively correlated, meaning higher temperatures indicate more bare land and lower temperatures indicate less bare land. We can also see that there are more samples with higher temperatures compared to lower temperatures.\n\n\n\nRelationship Between Bare Land and Spring Soil Water\nWe can see a negatively correlated relationship between the water in the spring soil and the percentage of bare land. The samples appear to be evenly distributed across both variables.\n\n\n\nRelationship Between Bare Land and Non-Dry Summer Soil Availability\nWe can see that there is a negative relationship between bare land percentage and non-dry summer soil availability. This indicates that the less water in the soil, which decreases over time as shown previously, increases the amount of bare land.\n\n\n\n\nSlight Increase in Tree Canopy\nThere is a slight increase in tree canopy over time which also demonstrates vegetation resilience. When segregating the historical and near-term data, we can see that there was an increase in tree canopy until 2018 but there is a recent decrease in tree canopy. This could suggest that the impacts of climate change have taken longer to impact the trees."
